##🔍 Inference Analysis
✅ Perfect Accuracy (1.0000)
Observation: The model achieved 100% accuracy on the inference dataset.

Explanation: This result is expected because the model was evaluated on the same dataset (sklearn.datasets.load_digits) it was trained on. The dataset is small (1797 well-structured samples), and Logistic Regression performs exceptionally well on such simple and clean classification tasks. This confirms that the model was correctly loaded and is making accurate predictions on familiar data.

🎯 Matching True vs. Predicted Labels
Observation: The first 10 predicted labels perfectly matched the first 10 actual labels.

Explanation: This serves as a visual confirmation of the model’s correctness. The exact match highlights that the inference logic is functioning properly and that there are no misclassifications in this sample.

📈 Total Predictions Made
Observation: A total of 1797 predictions were generated.

Explanation: This matches the exact number of records in the load_digits dataset. It verifies that the inference script processed the entire dataset as intended, with no records skipped or lost.
