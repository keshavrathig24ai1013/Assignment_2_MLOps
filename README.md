Analysis:

Perfect Accuracy (1.0000): o Observation: The model achieved 100% accuracy on the inference data. o Analysis: For this particular assignment, this high accuracy is expected. The sklearn.datasets.load_digits dataset is relatively small (1797 samples) and clean. More importantly, in this setup, the model is being evaluated on the same dataset it was trained on. Logistic Regression can easily achieve near-perfect or perfect scores on the training data itself for such a well-behaved and simple classification task. This confirms that the model was successfully loaded and is making correct predictions on the data it has already "seen."
Matching True vs. Predicted Labels: o Observation: The "First 10 true labels" perfectly match the "First 10 predictions." o Analysis: This visually reinforces the 100% accuracy. It confirms that the model's output directly corresponds to the ground truth for these initial samples, indicating no misclassifications in this subset.
Number of Predictions: o Observation: "Generated 1797 predictions." o Analysis: This matches the total number of samples in the sklearn.datasets.load_digits dataset. This confirms that the inference script processed the entire dataset as intended.
